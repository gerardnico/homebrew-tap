    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core
    # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the
    # software. Run the test with `brew test dockenv`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.

    #  system "#{bin}/script1", "--version"
    #  system "#{bin}/script2", "--help"
